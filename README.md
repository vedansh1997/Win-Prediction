Business Problem:IT firms face intense competition in securing lucrative deals, each differing in sector, technology, and scope, impacting revenue potential.
What We Are Trying to Achieve:We aim to enhance the win rate of deals by	predicting probabilities, enabling strategic resource allocation, and prioritization of opportunities.
Objectives:
	Predictive Analytics - Build an ML model to predict the probability of win/loss for bidding activities for a potential client.
	Prescriptive Analytics â€“ Identify variable/s that are most likely to help convert an opportunity into a win. 
Outcome:
	For a higher win rate, we have focused on the
	most profitable deals and patterns, to predict any
	false predictions and losses.
